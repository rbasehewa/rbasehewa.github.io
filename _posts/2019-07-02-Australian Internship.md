I have started my code review and changed to the company standard. The importance is stick to the standard are followings:

* Enables readers to understand the code more quickly by making assumptions based on their previous experience. 
* Produces a more stable and reliable code. 
* Make the standard easily available to each programmer. 

After the code fixing, I was working with which I implemented email template integrated to the Content Management System (CMS). Potentially, when you clicked the view from CMS and it should appear how many Autotask has completed and progress using status. I was working Autotask category section which has four sections, they are companies, Contacts, Projects, and Tickets. Theoretically, I was practising companies section only. My mentor wants me to work next week when you search the company check whether contacts and relevant email template. I'm going to implement add two buttons which are preview only and send function which is sent to the user as an email. 

I will see you next week. :) 

Cheers,
Ryan
