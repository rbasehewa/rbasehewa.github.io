TV Derana YouTube Channel has 3 million subscribers. 
Recently, It can be observed that the YouTube channel has been hacked and it’s logo has been changed, 700,000 posts disappeared and a bitcoin related video was broadcast live. 

## Purpose

The YouTubers believe that this is an attempt to gain further publicity and generate income by Search Engine Optimization that would occur as more people search for TV Derana on Google in an attempt to find out more details about the cyber attack. 


Cheers,
Ryan
