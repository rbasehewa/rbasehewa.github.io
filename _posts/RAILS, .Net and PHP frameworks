Most of the todayâ€™s software companies in the Industries chose Service Oriented Architecture 
as a service design paradigm for their applications. Web API is one of the approaches to implement the Service
Oriented Architecture. Every developer wants to develop a faster application. When it comes to choosing a correct
Service Oriented Architecture several factors must be considered and performances are one of them. Sometimes Software
developers find it difficult in choosing the correct framework based on the performances. According to the literature
review done, some of the papers have provided there are a comparative analysis of many technologies, but not specifically
focused on Performance comparing the CRUD and Image operations in .Net, Rails, and PHP. This research paper focuses on an
empirical study based on performance comparison between three Web API frameworks. .Net, Rails, and PHP on CRUD and Image
Operations to provide an effective analytical feedback to the users. A prototype has been built based on MVC architecture
on centralized database monitoring the time taken for each CRUDS and Image operations done by all three frameworks and 
represented in a graphical way to the users. Based on the results obtained from this research the developers
will be able to construct a better framework with high performance for their development.
