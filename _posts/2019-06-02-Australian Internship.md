I’m currently doing my internship at [Enee solution Pvt Ltd](https://enee.com.au) in Adelaide as a Web developer trainer. It is a great pleasure for me to work again development background. I got an opportunity to learn PHP Laravel framework. I moved to Australia in 2016, to chase my master’s degree while this time couldn’t get an opportunity to work in a software development background. I’m quite happy finally working related to my field.

In my workplace, I hope I will be having a better knowledge from my mentor, he is capable and knowledgeable to solve any problem, therefore, it would be a better opportunity to enhance my skills.

Currently, I started to work on Autotask API guidebook. According to this guidebook, it has predefined APIs. Theoretically, I have developed using company client data to matching according to the Autotask API documentation API code. I hope would be able to get a better outcome as well as if i have struggled I can get help from my mentor side by side. 

These are the following main skills I have learned in the first week of my internship :) 

    * Talked with colleagues and shared some interesting facts.
    * Work on simple PHP functions and coding.
    * Worked on Laracast channel to get an idea Blade and PHP environment.
    * Worked with PHP storm software.
    * Followed Autotask API documentation.
    * Worked on Laravel MVC framework.
    * Worked with Postman testing tool.
    * Worked on wsdp and asmx extensions.
    * Fetching data from controllers and model to View.
    * Send data from API to company client email template.
    * Had an awesome time on Friday night. 



I hope to continue untill the end of my internship. 

Cheers,
Ryan
