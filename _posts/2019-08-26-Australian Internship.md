I’m currently doing my internship at Enee solution Pvt Ltd in Adelaide as a Web developer trainer. I have previous experience in .Net framework around one year however, within this company I got an opportunity to learn PHP Laravel framework. I moved to Australia in 2016, to chase my master’s degree while this time framework couldn’t get an opportunity to work in a software development background. I’m quite happy finally work related to my field.

<p>In my workplace, I’m getting better knowledge from my mentor, he is capable and knowledgeable to solve any problem, therefore, it would be a better opportunity to enhance my skills.</p>

<p> Now I work on Autotask API guidebook. According to this guidebook, it has predefined APIs, theoretically, I develop using company client data to matching according to the Autotask API documentation API code. I would be able to get a better outcome and during this time my mentor guided me and teach me where I was struggled.</p>

These are the following main skills I have learned the first month on my internship

<ol>
<li>Go around the company and talk with all the employees who currently working with a receptionist.</li>

<li>Watched Laracast channel to get an idea Blade and PHP environment.</li>
<li>Work with PHP storm software.</li>
<li>Friday night having a good time with colleagues.</li>
</ol>

#### 2nd week:

I hope to continue 12 weeks my journal post.
