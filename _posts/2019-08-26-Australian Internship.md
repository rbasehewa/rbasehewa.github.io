I’m currently doing my internship at Enee solution Pvt Ltd in Adelaide as a Web developer trainer. I have previous experience in .Net framework around one year however, within this company I got an opportunity to learn PHP Laravel framework. I moved to Australia in 2016, to chase my master’s degree while this time framework couldn’t get an opportunity to work in a software development background. I’m quite happy finally work related to my field.

In my workplace, I’m getting better knowledge from my mentor, he is capable and knowledgeable to solve any problem, therefore, it would be a better opportunity to enhance my skills.

Now I work on Autotask API guidebook. According to this guidebook, it has predefined APIs, theoretically, I develop using company client data to matching according to the Autotask API documentation API code. I would be able to get a better outcome and during this time my mentor guided me and teach me where I was struggled.

These are the following main skills I have learned the first month on my internship

##### 1st week: 

--- Go around the company and talk with all the employees who currently working with a receptionist.
--- Work on simple PHP functions and coding.
--- Watched Laracast channel to get an idea Blade and PHP environment.
--- Work with PHP storm software.
--- Friday night having a good time with colleagues.


##### 2nd week: 

--- Follow and work with Autotask API documentation.
--- Worked on Laravel MVC framework.



##### 3rd week: 


--- Worked with Postman testing tool.
--- Worked on wsdp and asmx extensions.
--- Fetching data from controllers and model to View.
--- Trying to send data from API to company client email template.

I hope to continue 12 weeks my journal post. 

Cheers,
Ryan
