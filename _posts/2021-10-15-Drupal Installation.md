    Hi Guys,

    I would like to talk about Drupal installation.

    First of all, I have bought a course from "udemy.com" and trying to make install which they mentioned as it is. But i couldn't be able to do it. Because which i download xampp server(8.0.11) is not compatible with Druple 8 php version.

- Then after 6hrs, i found the easy solution to that.

  1. XAMPP download 7.4.24 version
  2. Drupal 8 download
  3. Then C:\xampp\htdocs to copy this Drupal project. You can change the folder name as you like, which would be your link http://localhost/drupal/
  4. After that, You can up the server and run the project. http://localhost/drupal/
  5. You will get system warning to contine the project, just do it and you need to give name and password to final stage.

  Here you go,

  - ![Final Version](https://github.com/rbasehewa/rbasehewa.github.io/blob/master/images/drupal.JPG?raw=true "Final version")

  Cheers,
  Ryan
