This is my 4th week and continued to work on my task which is sending data from API to company client email template.

I have struggled with many functions and call to syntax keywords.  Theoretically, I have worked View and Model on MVC architecture. In Autotask API have a lot of models and need to create a partial object. Then, i'm calling to main functions including fetch(), while in(), findbyID(), find by name() as a queries. Potentially, create the object and then call which is according to collection or array. 

On the other hand, in Autotask API main entities are Tickets and Time entries. When you fetch date format trying to match your current date and send it to the email template. I was struggled whole day work these formats but mentor asked not to covert and just send it as it is.  

## Highlighted points this week:

 * Working on Email template 
 * Trying to match fields data to from API 
 * Mostly working on Tickets and TimeEntry classes 
 * Trying to understand Tickets and TimeEntry models
 * Worked on billable and nonbillable data fields 
 * There is a table and my mentor asked me to get the data from API dynamically
 * Create date functions using Carbon format
 * Next week, I will work on code quality from my end. 

I would like to continue my journal. 

Cheers,
Ryan
