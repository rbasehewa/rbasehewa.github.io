This is my second week and continuing to work on my task which is sending data from API to company client email template.

I have struggled with many functions and call to syntax keywords. Theoretically, I have worked View and Model on MVC architecture. Using Autotask API having a lot of models and need to create a partial object. Therefore, i was talking to main functions including fetch(), while in(), findbyID(), find by name() as a query methods. Potentially, these methods talking with array or collections. 

On the other hand, in Autotask API main entities are Tickets and Time entries. When you fetch date format trying to match your current date and send it to the email template. I was struggled whole day work these formats but mentor asked not to convert and just send it as it is.  

## Highlighted points this week:

 * Working on Email template 
 * Trying to match fields data to API 
 * Mostly working on Tickets and TimeEntry classes 
 * Trying to understand Tickets and TimeEntry models
 * Worked on billable and nonbillable data fields 
 * Get the data from API dynamically
 * Create date functions using Carbon format
 * Next week, I hope to work on code quality

I will see you next week. :) 

Cheers,
Ryan
